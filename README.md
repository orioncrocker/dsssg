## Dead simple static site generator

dsssg is exactly what it claims to be: a static website generator that is dead simple.

This project represents a reaction to ubiquitous and bloated web frameworks that should be considered overkill when creating simple websites.

Simply drop in a few Markdown files, edit the templates provided to you, and bam!
You've got yourself a simple website.

Dates for posts are generated by initial git commit, so posts that aren't committed yet won't work correctly.

Websites can be built and deployed using Make:

``` sh
    make build
```
