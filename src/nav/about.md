# About Me

![headshot](/data/images/headshot.png)

Hello! Welcome to my website.

After finishing my junior year at [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/) studying Computer Science, I realized that I still had no idea how to create or design a website.
This site represents a personal project to become more familiar with basic web design and get a better understanding of how the internet functions from the ground up.

Thanks for stopping by.
