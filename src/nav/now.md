# What I'm doing now
April 5th, 2021

Currently seeking employment in the greater San Diego area, but I'm open to work remotely.
If you are looking to hire a junior programmer or know someone who is, start a conversation with me at [orion@orionc.dev](mailto:orion@orionc.dev).

As of April 22nd, I have satisfied all requirements for a Bachelor's in Computer Science at Portland State.
I expect to recieve my incredibly expensive piece of paper in the mail sometime in early June.

Current project list:

1. Gainful employment
2. Improve and add content to this website
3. [Albumartdb.com](https://albumartdb.com) (coming soon!)
4. Maintaining my 300 sqft garden
5. Make 2021 better than 2020
